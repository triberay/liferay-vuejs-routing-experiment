What if we can attach the Vue.js routing to the Liferay SPA routing?

Idea is that the Vue app is added to the theme, and loaded automatically on every page. 
Navigating to a new page in Liferay SPA will also trigger the routing in the Vue App

See:
* config of first routing portlet
* SPA transitions
